						<i>Breathe</i> is an Android application that learns about you and the things you do. It is also a stress detection, reduction, and avoidance system. Paired with a Microsoft Band v2, <i>Breathe</i> monitors a user's stress level in real time using patterns in his or her RR-Interval, the time interval between his or her individual heart beats. In addition to a users stress level, <i>Breathe</i> constantly records the surrounding ambient noise level of the user's environment and the user's level of physical activity.
					</p> 
					<p>
						<i>Breathe</i> takes all that sensor data and cross references it with the user's calendar events. In doing so, Breathe is able to find correlations between stressful events in the user's life and the combination of factors that caused said stress (e.g. certain people, times of day, locations, activities, etc.). Using the determined correlations, Breathe is able to predict which upcoming calendar events are most likely to be stressful and empowers the user to take action to reduce his or her likelihood of stress. Now, instead of worrying about all of the pressures of your life, you can sit back, relax, and just <i>breathe</i>.
